My approach to this simple task - will try to bloat it beyond reason :)


## Some people treat this as an interview excercise, so why not make it a bit more complex.

## Done so far:
1. Initial simple function

## To be done (if i have time)
1. Extend function into module / class
2. Create node server to run it
3. Create unit tests for it
4. Add docker? :P 
5. Add linter - because why not
